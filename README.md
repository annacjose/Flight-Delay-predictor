# Mid-Term Project

The goal of this project is to predict arrival delays of commercial flights. Often, there is not much airlines can do to avoid the delays, therefore, they play an important role in both profits and loss of the airlines. It is critical for airlines to estimate flight delays as accurate as possible because the results can be applied to both, improvements in customer satisfaction and income of airline agencies.
